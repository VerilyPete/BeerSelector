Toasted and baked bread, English biscuits that adds just a touch of sweetness.  Enough grassy hops to let you know its there, but doesn't leave any real bitterness.  A light body with enough carbonation to have a little crispness.  Though becomes soft and ultra smooth after a minute.  A very nice clean finish as well.  I enjoyed this a lot and can come back to this with ease.",

Both were aged in freshly emptied Willett Bourbon barrels, with one variation aged in coconut. In the classic WBA Double Pecan Porter, you\\'ll find notes of boozy vanilla, pecans, coffee and chocolate. The \\'Coconut Surprise\\' brings a tinge of sweet toasty coconut, which marries nicely with the notes of coffee, vanilla and pecan. Both of these brews sit right at 9.5% ABV, enjoy responsibly. ",
