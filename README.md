### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm start                 # Start Expo development server
npm run ios              # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android          # Run on Android emulator
npm run web              # Run web version

# Testing
npm test                 # vitest (logic suites), watch mode
npm run test:rn          # jest-expo (component suites), watch mode
npm run test:ci          # both, in sequence, with coverage

# Utilities
npm run reset-project    # Reset project state
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
```

### Testing

The suite runs on **two runners, split by file extension**:

|              | Runner    | Environment                            |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `*.test.ts`  | vitest    | node — pure logic, no renderer         |
| `*.test.tsx` | jest-expo | React Native renderer and native mocks |

Pick the runner from the extension of the file you want; `npx jest` on a
`.test.ts` matches nothing, and vice versa.

```bash
npm test                 # vitest, watch mode
npm run test:rn          # jest-expo, watch mode
npm run test:ci          # both, in sequence, with coverage

npx vitest run src/services/__tests__/dataUpdateService.test.ts
npx jest --config=jest.config.js components/beer/__tests__/BeerItem.test.tsx
```

What is covered: unit tests for functions and database operations, integration
tests for API and database flows, component rendering tests, and TypeScript type
guard validation. Integration and E2E flows that need a device run on Maestro
(`npm run test:e2e`), not on either unit runner.

## Deployment

### Building for Production

1. **Configure app.json** with your app details
2. **Build for platforms:**

   ```bash
   # iOS
   npx expo run:ios --configuration Release

   # Android
   npx expo run:android --variant release
   ```

3. **Submit to app stores** using Expo's build service or EAS Build

### Environment Configuration

- **Development**: Uses Expo development server
- **Production**: Configured for app store deployment
- **API Endpoints**: Managed through app settings

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React Native best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Check Node.js version compatibility

**Database issues:**

- Reset the database: `npm run reset-project`
- Check API URL configuration in settings
- Verify network connectivity

**Build errors:**

- Update Expo CLI: `npm install -g @expo/cli@latest`
- Clear build cache: `npx expo run:ios --clear` or `npx expo run:android --clear`
