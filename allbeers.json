Not particularly aromatic, which isn't unusual for the style. Though a simple bread, biscuit, and very light grassy hop character is noticeable.  A fuller malty flavor.  Toasted and baked bread, English biscuits that adds just a touch of sweetness.  Enough grassy hops to let you know its there, but doesn't leave any real bitterness.  A light body with enough carbonation to have a little crispness.  Though becomes soft and ultra smooth after a minute.  A very nice clean finish as well.  I enjoyed this a lot and can come back to this with ease."
