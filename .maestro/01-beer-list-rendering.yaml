# Test Flow: Beer List Rendering and Scrolling
# This test verifies that the beer list loads and renders correctly,
# with proper scrolling behavior and virtualization.

# Step 1: Launch app and wait for initialization
- launchApp:
    clearState: false

# Step 2: Wait for database initialization
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Dismiss Expo dev menu if present
- runFlow:
    when:
      visible: "Reload"
    commands:
      - pressKey: Escape
      - waitForAnimationToEnd

# Step 3: Navigate to All Beer tab (if not already there)
- tapOn: "All Beer"
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Step 4: Verify beer list container is visible
- assertVisible:
    id: "all-beers-container"

# Step 5: Verify search bar is present
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-bar"

# Step 6: Verify filter bar is present
- assertVisible:
    id: "filter-bar"

# Step 7: Verify beer count is displayed
- assertVisible:
    id: "beer-count"

# Step 8: Verify at least some beers are loaded (beer count > 0)
- assertVisible:
    id: "beer-list"

# Step 9: Verify first beer item is visible
# Note: We can't assert specific beer IDs without knowing the data
# but we can verify the list contains beer items
- assertVisible:
    id: "beer-item-.*"

# Step 10: Test scroll performance - scroll down slowly
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:
      id: "beer-item-.*"
    direction: DOWN
    speed: 40  # Slow scroll to test frame rate

# Step 11: Scroll to bottom of list (test virtualization)
- repeat:
    times: 5
    commands:
      - swipe:
          direction: DOWN
      - waitForAnimationToEnd

# Step 12: Scroll back to top
- repeat:
    times: 5
    commands:
      - swipe:
          direction: UP
      - waitForAnimationToEnd

# Step 13: Verify we're back at top (first items visible)
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-bar"

# Step 14: Test pull-to-refresh gesture
- swipe:
    direction: DOWN
    from:
      id: "beer-list"
    duration: 1000

# Step 15: Wait for refresh to complete
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Step 16: Verify list is still visible after refresh
- assertVisible:
    id: "beer-list"

# Step 17: Verify beer count is still displayed
- assertVisible:
    id: "beer-count"
